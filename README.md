# Double Click To View Center

This is an add-in for ABB RobotStudio developed with RobotStudio SDK. This add-in extends the UI of RobotStudio so that users can double click on any object in the 3D-view to 
center the camera on the object. Holding down the SHIFT key while performing a double click will instead examine the selected object so that the camera zooms in on the object so
so that the object fits the screen.
